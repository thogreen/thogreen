I am a senior and I am graduating in May! This is my 5th year of college and I went to a junior college before I came to Augusta. I hope to find an IT job before the summer in Atlanta. I am interested in learning everything I can about infrastructure. I believe that is the route in IT I am going to take. My hobbies are golfing and enjoying the outdoors.
